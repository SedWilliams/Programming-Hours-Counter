# Programming-Hours-Counter
This project ~~is~~ was in daily use to track the amount of hours that I spent programming. I ran the script in the background on a terminal instance, and used a command line argument to log my time into a MongoDB database. The project is no longer in use due to me running out of free space on my MongoDB instance.

# Do not attempt to run this
This is simply a practice project to get comfortable with writing scripts, NoSQL DBs, and practicing my programming in general. If you run this code despite knowing this, it's likely nothing will happen as the DB connected to it is inactive.
